    The data was provided by New York City. More specifically NYC Open Data and The New York Department of Data. They were mostly looking for Eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis). The data was collected by volunteers in 2018.
    \nBased on the sample, it is evident that the squirrel population is likely aging. 88% of the squirrels are adults, leaving only 12% of the population as juveniles ignoring the negligible number of animals of unknown age. The sample contains over 3,000 entries, that were collected over a two-week period from October 6th, 2018, until October 20th, 2018. There were only five squirrels that were sampled multiple times, during the duration of the study. Fifty-five percent of the data was collected in the daytime, while 45% of the data was collected during the evening.

The squirrels vary phenotypically. A vast majority of the squirrels are primarily gray. The secondary colors of the squirrels vary more dramatically. This may suggest that the squirrels are different species or vary in color for some other unspecified reasons.

The maps were the most elucidating aspect of this project. The breadths (width) of the rectangular park have the most squirrel activity overall. Central Park South is teeming with life, commerce, and human traffic. In addition to these, locals, and tourists alike, patronize food trucks at the border of the park. Additionally, there is a large mall and several restaurants where people will bring food and eat near the border of the park. It is not uncommon for people to drop food intentionally and unintentionally dropped by people on their leisurely stroll. There is even more activity in this area of the park near Central Park North. This is somewhat surprising considering Central Park North has considerably fewer things to do and is less remarkable. However, the heatmap reveals that Columbus‚Äôs circle is busier than any other frontier along the width. The whole park is filled with unique squirrel sightings. This helps show that park is a vital biome to the city. However, there is some considerable activity near certain bodies of water, especially ‚ÄúThe Lake‚Äù. Certain areas of the park are devoid of squirrel activity such as the playground, which shows that squirrels still respect certain spaces that humans frequent likely due to lack of foraging opportunities.

Unfortunately, the activity facet of the squirrels of central park is somewhat limited. Most of the behavior‚Äôs researchers looked for within their ethogram were false, in the true/false section. It would have been immensely difficult for researchers to write down their other observations after already noting some other information. To get a better grasp of animal behavior, fewer squirrels would have to be observed to describe them in more vivid detail.

Much of this information comes from the writer/analyst repertoire. He took a course in animal behavior and interned in New York City. He has also spent several hours walking through the park. - Alonzo R.
